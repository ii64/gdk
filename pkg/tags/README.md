# Tags
Tags is a package to create a standardized tracking tags on logging, telemetry, tracing, alert, and any operation that requires tag.
Centralized the list of available tags helps us standardized and make it easy to find to create automatic alert, logging, or any operation that requires tags because we have a uniform tags.

### Problems:
A service can have tags `product`, `product_name`, and `product_id`, where product can be filled with either product name or id depending on the tracking and who put the tracking.

### Solution:
Create a uniform tags where the content is clear for each tag.
